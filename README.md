- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SHIBALGO-Nakamoto
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in changing the world through the power of cryptocurrencies and the crypto community. 
That's why I created SHIBALGO. There was popular demand for meme coins on the Algorand network based off some recent reddit posts, so I made one!
But this coin is supposed to do good in the world. Donations will be made by the SHIBALGO foundation each month. 
At first, those donations will go to the ASPCA to support our SHIBA canine and feline friends :) 
After more widespread adoption of the coin, governors will vote monthly on a charity to receive a donation. 
Further, the coin will be deflationary -- each month, an equal amount of the coins will be burned as the amount sent to the monthly charity chosen. 
We can do good in the world with memes together, all on the Algorand network!
